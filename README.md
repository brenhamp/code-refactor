# Code Refactor for Horiseon

I have refactored the HTML and CSS of this website to make it easier to read and modify, while maintaining functionality of the code.

## Change Log

* Added a :root formatting key to CSS, to reduce redundancy and make future changes easier.
* Condensed and removed repetitive classes.
* Restored functionality to the navigation bar. "Search Engine Optimization" in the header was incorrectly assigned.
* Renamed some divs into sections for better comprehension and compatibility with site readers.
* Changed "website" to "Horiseon" in title.
* Cleaned up code spacing.
